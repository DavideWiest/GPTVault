    "title": "Zinc Finger Nucleases",
    "definition": "Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) are engineered proteins that can be used to modify DNA sequences. They consist of a DNA-binding domain, typically derived from zinc finger proteins, and a DNA-cleavage domain, usually derived from the FokI endonuclease. ZFNs can be designed to target specific DNA sequences and induce double-strand breaks, which can then be repaired by the cell's DNA repair machinery to introduce desired genetic modifications.",
