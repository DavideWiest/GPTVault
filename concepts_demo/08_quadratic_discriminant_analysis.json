    "definition": "Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) is a classification algorithm that is used to model and classify data based on a quadratic decision boundary. It is an extension of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and assumes that the data follows a multivariate normal distribution with different covariance matrices for each class.",
