    "definition": "SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to solve Markov decision processes (MDPs). It is an on-policy algorithm, meaning that it learns the value function and policy while following the current policy. SARSA updates the Q-values based on the current state, action, reward, next state, and next action.",
