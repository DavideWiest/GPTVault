# Definition:
Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics that focuses on summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. It involves the calculation and presentation of measures such as measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (e.g., range, standard deviation). Descriptive statistics provide a way to understand and interpret data without making any inferences or conclusions beyond the data itself.
