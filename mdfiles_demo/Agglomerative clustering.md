# Definition:
Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that starts with each data point as a separate cluster and iteratively merges the closest pairs of clusters until a stopping criterion is met. It is a bottom-up approach where the clusters are formed by progressively merging smaller clusters into larger ones.
