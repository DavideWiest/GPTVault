# Definition:
Self-determination theory is a psychological framework that focuses on the motivation behind human behavior and the factors that contribute to personal growth and well-being. It suggests that individuals have three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness, and when these needs are satisfied, they are more likely to experience intrinsic motivation and psychological well-being.
