    "title": "Total Internal Reflection",
    "definition": "Total internal reflection is the phenomenon that occurs when a ray of light traveling in a medium with a higher refractive index strikes the boundary with a medium of lower refractive index at an angle greater than the critical angle. Instead of refracting, the light is completely reflected back into the original medium.",
