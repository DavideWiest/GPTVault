    "definition": "Non-homogeneous second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are differential equations of the form y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = g(x), where p(x), q(x), and g(x) are given functions of x. These equations involve the second derivative of the dependent variable y with respect to the independent variable x, as well as its first derivative and the function itself.",
