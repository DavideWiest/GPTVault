# Definition:
Sturm-Liouville theory is a mathematical theory that deals with second-order linear ordinary differential equations. It provides a framework for solving these equations by transforming them into a standard form and finding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the associated Sturm-Liouville operator.
