# Definition:
Total internal reflection is the phenomenon that occurs when a ray of light traveling in a medium with a higher refractive index strikes the boundary with a medium of lower refractive index at an angle greater than the critical angle. Instead of refracting, the light is completely reflected back into the original medium.
