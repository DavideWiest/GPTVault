# Definition:
Polymer nanocomposites are materials that consist of a polymer matrix filled with nanoparticles. These nanoparticles can be of various types, such as clay, carbon nanotubes, or metal oxides. The addition of nanoparticles to the polymer matrix enhances the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the resulting composite material.
