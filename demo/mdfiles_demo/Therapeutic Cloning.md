# Definition:
Therapeutic cloning, also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, is a technique used to create embryonic stem cells for medical purposes. It involves taking the nucleus of a somatic cell and transferring it into an egg cell that has had its nucleus removed. The resulting embryo can be used to derive embryonic stem cells that are genetically identical to the donor of the somatic cell.
